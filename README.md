# ML project

## Getting started 

Welcome to the repository of the Airbnb Price Prediction ML project!
Authors: Seong Woo AHN, Paul BERARD, Leila BERRADA, Tanguy BLERVACQUE

### Data

You can find 4 csv files:
- train_airbnb_berlin.csv: the main dataset for Airbnb listings and prices in Berlin.
- test_airbnb_berlin.csv: unused.
- train_airbnb_berlin_preprocessed.csv: a first version of the preprocessed dataset.
- train_airbnb_berlin_preprocessed_2.csv: a second version of the preprocessed dataset.
- models_fwd_xgb.json: a json file related to work done for the XGBoost regression method.

It should be noted that there are variations to the processed datasets in each branch.

### Models

Contains the .h5 file for the NLP model used to generate the "host gender" feature.
